# Monster Chase

This was a simple and fun project to learn something about Unity engine and C#. Coming from JS and Frontend technologies, I wanted to have a go at some GameDev and a more traditional / strongly-typed programming language like C#, to better understand concepts like signatures, class inheritance and event delegates. 
I am proud and happy to say that it was a challenging experience, I really had to get my gears turning several times ^_^" and it was totally worth it. <br>
